## Assignment: Simple Linear Regression with CRISP-DM

### 1. Project Setup

- **Action:** Create `requirements.txt` file.
- **Purpose:** To define the Python dependencies required for the project.
- **Command:** `write_file`
- **Parameters:**
    - `file_path`: `C:\Users\michael\Downloads\AIOT_HW1\requirements.txt`
    - `content`: `streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
`
- **Result:** Successfully created `requirements.txt`.

### 2. Application Development

- **Action:** Create `app.py` file.
- **Purpose:** To build the Streamlit web application for simple linear regression.
- **Command:** `write_file`
- **Parameters:**
    - `file_path`: `C:\Users\michael\Downloads\AIOT_HW1\app.py`
    - `content`: (The full content of the app.py file as created in the previous step)
- **Result:** Successfully created `app.py` with the complete Streamlit application code.

### 3. Running the Application

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory (`C:\Users\michael\Downloads\AIOT_HW1`). Then, run the following command to install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the App:** After the installation is complete, run the following command to start the Streamlit application:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3.  **View the App:** Your web browser should automatically open a new tab with the application running. If it doesn't, the terminal will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) that you can open in your browser.

### 4. Deployment to Streamlit Cloud

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository:** Create a new repository on GitHub and upload the `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `log.md` files.
2.  **Sign up for Streamlit Cloud:** If you don't have an account, sign up for a free account at [https://streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).
3.  **Deploy the App:** From your Streamlit Cloud dashboard, click on "New app" and connect your GitHub account. Select the repository you created, and then choose the `app.py` file. Click "Deploy!" and your application will be live.
